# Facial_Emotion_Detection1
A comprehensive comparison study of various Convolutional Neural Network architectures for human facial emotion recognition. This project evaluates multiple CNN models to identify the best performing architecture for classifying facial expressions into four categories: Happy, Sad, Surprise, and Neutral.
# ðŸ“Š Dataset
Input: Facial images containing human expressions
The data set is preprocessed and divided into a training, validation and test section.
Output Classes: 4 emotion categories
Happy
Sad
Surprise
Neutral

# ðŸ§  Models Implemented
Multiple CNN architectures were developed and compared, including:
Custom CNN models with varying depths
Transfer learning approaches
Different activation functions and optimization techniques

# ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation & Results
The project includes comprehensive model evaluation using:
Accuracy metrics
Confusion matrices
Precision, Recall, and F1-scores
Training/validation loss curves

Best Model Selection: Based on rigorous testing and comparison of accuracy metrics across all implemented models.

# ðŸŽ“ Learning Opportunity
Feel free to fork, experiment, and play around with the models! This repository is designed to be a hands-on learning resource for understanding:
CNN architecture design
Deep learning fundamentals
Computer vision applications
